# DermaSense-AI-Powered-Skin-Analysis-and-Product-Recommendation
DermaSense is an AI-driven skin analysis system that utilizes computer vision to analyze skin conditions and recommend personalized skincare products. Using YOLOv8, the project offers precise skin analysis by detecting skin conditions like acne, wrinkles, pigmentation, and more, followed by intelligent product recommendations based on the analysis.

Key Features
- Skin Condition Detection: Leveraging YOLOv8, DermaSense detects and classifies skin conditions such as acne, wrinkles, pigmentation, and other skin imperfections.
- Personalized Product Recommendations: The system suggests skincare products tailored to the individualâ€™s skin analysis, ensuring the best care for their unique needs.
- Image Preprocessing: Advanced image preprocessing techniques are applied to enhance skin features and improve the accuracy of analysis.
- Real-Time Analysis: The system supports real-time skin analysis through webcam or uploaded images, providing immediate feedback to users.
- Cloud-Based Model: The AI model is hosted on the cloud, ensuring scalability, seamless updates, and easy integration with other applications.

Technologies Used
- YOLOv8: The computer vision model for detecting and classifying skin conditions with high accuracy.
- OpenCV: Used for image preprocessing and enhancement before the model performs analysis.
- TensorFlow: For implementing and deploying the YOLOv8 model.
- Python: The main programming language used for developing the system and training the model.
- Cloud Computing: For hosting the model, ensuring scalability, and providing remote access.
